Both encountered in the hitherto unknown folk music of their respective countries an 'Other' that enabled them to develop an idiom different from the mainstream but equally coherent. Sibelius became in Finland a national hero due to his patriotic music from the turn-of-the-century. As a consequence, his figure grew into mountainous dimensions, and many of his successors were doomed to live under his shadow. After World War II a new beginning was needed. - Ilkka Oramo",
