      <p>
        I am a health nut, nature bound and notoriously good at self-discipline.
        I tend to process things in logical rather than emotional ways and like
        to categorize information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love debugging , walking long distances, drinking a lot of water and
        being friends with non-human animals. I live according to a combination
        between Buddhism and Modern Stoicism values and like to walk my path
        along with people who respect the four cardinal virtues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I study Art Criticism and I am a software developer and IT as well, my
        main goal is to make this a better world and improve human and non human
        animals's life quality through my actions impact, so please contact me
        only if you really feel we can potentiate each other and make the world
        a better place.
